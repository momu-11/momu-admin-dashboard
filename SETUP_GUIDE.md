# Momu Admin Dashboard Setup Guide

This guide will help you complete the setup of your Momu Admin Dashboard.

## Prerequisites Completed ✅

- ✅ React app created with TypeScript
- ✅ All dependencies installed (Material UI, etc.)
- ✅ GitHub repository created at https://github.com/momu-11/momu-admin-dashboard
- ✅ Mock data setup configured
- ✅ Basic project structure created

## Next Steps

### 1. Mock Data Setup

This project uses mock data for demonstration purposes.
No external database setup is required.

### 2. Admin Access

The dashboard comes with pre-configured admin credentials:

- **Email**: `momu.app@gmail.com`
- **Password**: `admin`

These are hardcoded in the mock authentication system.

### 3. Test the Application

```bash
npm start
```

The application should now:
- Uses mock data (no database required)
- Allow admin login
- Display the dashboard with proper database connection

### 6. Deploy (Optional)

For production deployment:

```bash
npm run build
```

Then deploy the `build` folder to your hosting provider (Vercel, Netlify, etc.).

## File Structure

```
momu-admin-dashboard/
├── src/
│   ├── components/        # Future admin components
│   ├── context/          # Authentication context
│   ├── lib/              # Mock data and utilities
│   ├── pages/            # Login and Dashboard pages
│   └── types.ts          # TypeScript definitions
├── database_setup.sql    # Database schema and sample data
# Removed: supabase/     # (Supabase CLI configuration removed)
└── README.md            # Project documentation
```

## Available Features

Once setup is complete, you'll have:

- **Secure Admin Login**: Only authorized admins can access
- **User Management**: View and manage user accounts
- **Community Oversight**: Monitor community activities
- **Support System**: Handle user support requests
- **Content Moderation**: Review and act on reports
- **Dark Theme**: Modern purple gradient design

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues
- The project uses mock data (no configuration needed)
- Ensure the database tables exist (run `database_setup.sql`)
- Check if Row Level Security policies are properly configured

### Authentication Issues
- Verify admin email/ID in `AuthContext.tsx`
- Use the default admin credentials (email: momu.app@gmail.com, password: admin)
- Check browser console for authentication errors

### Build Issues
- Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
- Check for TypeScript errors with `npm run build`

## Next Development Steps

The basic structure is ready. You can now:

1. Add more detailed admin components
2. Connect to a real database backend
3. Add more sophisticated user management features
4. Create detailed reporting and analytics
5. Add email notifications for support requests
